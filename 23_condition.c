/*
# what is condition?
    -conditions are way to implement a logical situation. in programming, sometimes we have different situation and based on one situation we have to execute some sort of code rather than other situation.

# ex: if a user logged in our system, we want to show their name. otherwise, we want to show login button.

# condition statement in c programming -
    1. if condition
    2. else condition
    3. else if condition
