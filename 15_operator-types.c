# what is operand and operator?
    a + b => here '+' is operator, 'a' and 'b' is operand.

# there are mainly three types of operator available -
    > unary
    > bainary
    > ternary

    unary operators: only have one operand. ex: a++, --b
    binary operators: have two operand. ex: a + b, a - b
        there are different type of binary operator are available -
        > arithematic (+, -, *, /, %)
        > relational (==, >, <, !=, >=, <=)
        > logical (&&, ||, !)
        > assignment (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=)
        > bitwise (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>)
    ternary oparators: have three operand. ex: conditional operator
