/*
# what is loops?
    -the loop is a statement that repeats a given task for a given amount of time.
    ex. find the even number between 1~100.

# why do we use a loop?
    -in programming, we have always the same relative task. to reduce repeated code, we use a loop.
    ex. we have a student database and we want to sent notifications to each of them. manually it is impossible to send notification one by one.

# type of loops in c programming
    1. for loop (follow step)
    2. while loop (follow condition)
    2. do while loop (follow condition but execute at least one time)
